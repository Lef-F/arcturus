# Arcturus — Developer Reference

This file is repo geography (what the code is, where it lives, what it does). Two sibling docs are auto-loaded so you start every session with the full picture:

- @DOCTRINE.md — *how* to work on this codebase: zen, quality bar, the cycle.
- @AGENTS.md — task-runner protocol: code rules, process rules, testing rules, audit checklist.

When the three conflict, DOCTRINE wins for *how*, this file wins for *what*, AGENTS wins for *which task next*.

**Browser-based virtual analog synthesizer** designed around Arturia hardware:
- **BeatStep / BeatStep Black Edition** — 16 relative encoders (synthesis parameters) + 16 pads (module/program select). The only device that needs identification + calibration.
- **KeyStep Standard, KeyStep 32, or any other MIDI keyboard** — notes, pitch bend, aftertouch, mod wheel, transport. Treated as a generic note source; no calibration required.

The hardware IS the preferred interface — but the synth is fully playable without it. The
computer keyboard plays notes (A–K, Z/X to shift octaves, 1–8 to switch programs, Shift+1–8 to switch modules), the mouse drives encoders (scroll
or vertical drag) and pads (click). Whatever you have plugged in is added on top.

---

## Purpose

A hardware-first, software-rendered synthesizer. The goal is to feel like a real instrument:
every knob turn has immediate, musical effect; every program switch is smooth (soft takeover);
the sound is deep enough to get lost in.

Architecturally inspired by the Prophet-5, Juno-106, JP-8000, Oberheim SEM, and Buchla 208.
See `docs/SOUND_ENGINE.md` for the full synthesis reference and design decisions.
See `docs/SYNTH_RESEARCH.md` for primary-source hardware citations.

## Core Principles

### 1. Hardware-first, no frameworks
Vanilla TypeScript + DOM API. No React, Vue, or Lit. One concern per module.
CSS uses design tokens only — never hardcode colors, radii, or font sizes.
`@/` import alias maps to `src/`.

### 2. The store is the single source of truth
`ParameterStore` in `src/audio/params.ts` owns all parameter values and soft-takeover state.
Nothing else tracks parameter values independently.
- `onParamChange` is the app's concern — wire it in `app.ts`, never in `mapper.ts`
- Snapshots capture **all** params, including `voices`
- Patches round-trip through IndexedDB as `Record<string, number>` keyed by Faust path

### 3. The mapper is a routing layer only
`ControlMapper` translates MIDI CC → store delta. It holds no state.
It does not know about the engine, callbacks, or voice counting.
Encoder delta from `EncoderManager` is already scaled by `1/64`.
When calling `processParamDelta` directly from the mapper, use `sensitivity=1` (no double-scaling).

### 4. Additive mixing, not fake normalization
Hardware synthesizers sum signals additively and let the user manage levels.
OSC B blends as `oscA + oscB * oscb_level` — not divided by a normalization factor.

### 5. No dead code, no double-bookkeeping
If two code paths both update the same thing, one is wrong. Find it and delete it.
`buildEncoderMappings()` is the canonical example — removed because the module system superseded it.

### 6. No backwards compatibility, no legacy code
This is a dev-phase project. Never keep old fields, migration paths, compatibility shims,
or deprecated wrappers. When a pattern is superseded, delete the old code completely.
If IndexedDB schema changes, users recalibrate — don't write migration logic.

### 7. TypeScript strict mode, always
Zero `any` in production code. Zero `@ts-ignore`. Use the type system.
All shared types live in `src/types.ts`.

### 8. Test before you move on
`pnpm test` must pass before committing. `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` too.
Virtual MIDI is the hardware in tests — never assume a real device.
Do not reduce the overall test count without a good reason.

**Audio signal tests** compile real Faust WASM offline — no browser needed.
- `src/test/audio-signal.test.ts` — synth.dsp MIDI → DSP → audio (per-param sweep)
- `src/test/effects-signal.test.ts` — effects.dsp mono processor sweep
- `src/test/transition.test.ts` — click-free transition validation
- `src/test/preset-sonic.test.ts` — factory preset audio + spectral diversity
- `src/test/faust-loader.ts` — shared loader with cross-process lock (used by all 4 above)
Uses `ParamSignalHints` metadata on `SynthParam` to drive test behavior.
Every param has `ParamSignalHints`. See `docs/SIGNAL_TESTING.md` for the framework reference.

### Module system

8 modules × 16 encoder slots. Defined in `MODULES` array in `src/audio/params.ts`.
`getModuleParams(moduleIndex)` resolves slots to `SynthParam | null`.
Module layout: OSCA, OSCB, FLTR, ENV, MOD, FX, GLOB, SCENE.
The GLOB module (index 6) owns `voices`, `vintage`, `unison`, `unison_detune`.
The `unison` param also sets `engine.unison` in `app.ts` (engine-level voice stacking).

### BeatStep mapping

BeatStep CC and pad-note assignments come from a `BeatStepMapping` object (defined in
`src/types.ts`), produced by calibration and stored in the `beatstep_profiles` IndexedDB store.
Zero hardcoded MIDI values in production code. `ControlMapper`, `EncoderManager`, and
`PadHandler` all require explicit configuration — no factory defaults.

The mapping is **nullable** in app state: `BeatStepMapping | null`. When null (no BeatStep
calibrated/connected), `ControlMapper` and `PadHandler` are not constructed. Mouse-driven
encoder scroll/drag and pad clicks still work and route through the same callbacks the
BeatStep would.

Tests use `TEST_BEATSTEP_MAPPING` from `src/test/helpers.ts` (sequential CCs 1-16, notes 44-51/36-43).

### Boot flow

```
boot()
  ├─ saved BeatStep profile? → mount synth view with that mapping
  ├─ BeatStep currently connected (port-name scan)? → run calibration
  └─ neither → mount synth view with mapping=null (mouse + keyboard only)

After mount: welcome overlay layers on top if first visit (gated by IndexedDB "welcomed_v1").
Hot-plugging a BeatStep mid-session shows a non-blocking "Calibrate?" toast.
```

### Signal flow

```
Computer keyboard (always live) → NoteHandler → EnginePool.getActiveEngine().keyOn/keyOff
Any non-BeatStep MIDI input    → MIDIManager.onNoteSourceMessage → NoteHandler → engine
BeatStep encoders/master       → MIDIManager.onBeatstepMessage → ControlMapper → ParameterStore
BeatStep pads                  → MIDIManager.onBeatstepMessage → PadHandler → SceneLatch / EnginePool
Mouse scroll/drag on encoders  → SynthView.onEncoderScroll/onMasterScroll → ParameterStore
Mouse click on pads            → SynthView.onModuleSelect/onProgramSelect → SceneLatch / EnginePool

BeatStepMapping → ControlMapper(encoders, masterCC) + PadHandler.setPadNotes(row1, row2)
```

### Multi-engine architecture

EnginePool manages one engine per latched program. WASM is compiled once at boot via
`SynthEngine.compileGenerators()`, then reused via `startFromGenerators()` for each new engine.

```
Engine 0 (P1 frozen): synthNode → fxNode ─┐
Engine 1 (P3 active): synthNode → fxNode ─┤→ masterGain → analyser → destination
Engine 2 (P5 frozen): synthNode → fxNode ─┘
```

- Active engine receives param changes + new notes
- Frozen engines keep their sound + latched notes independently
- Focusing a frozen engine makes it active (encoders control it)
- Unlatching destroys the frozen engine
- Master volume is global via `masterGain`

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev            # Dev server at localhost:5173 (computer keyboard always live; plug in real MIDI for the real thing)
pnpm build          # tsc + vite build
pnpm preview        # Preview production build (needs COOP/COEP headers)
pnpm typecheck      # tsc --noEmit (zero errors expected)
pnpm lint           # ESLint (zero warnings expected)
pnpm test           # Run all tests (offline Faust signal sweeps + unit + integration)
pnpm test:watch     # Watch mode
pnpm test:coverage  # Coverage report
```

---

## Visual Design

**Aesthetic:** OP-1 × Serum hybrid. Warm, playful, rounded. Professional but not clinical.

**Palette:** Phosphor Observer — dark backgrounds, cyan primary (`#26fedc`), warm amber accents.
All design tokens in `src/styles/main.css`. Never hardcode a color outside this file.

## Things to Always Keep Up To Date

When you make changes, keep these files in sync:

| File | Update when… |
|------|-------------|
| **`CLAUDE.md`** (this file) | Architecture changes, new conventions, major refactors, new tooling |
| **`AGENTS.md`** | Milestones complete, process changes, file map changes, new rules emerge |
| **`docs/SOUND_ENGINE.md`** | Any parameter added/removed/renamed, module layout changes, DSP behavior changes |
| **`src/audio/params.ts`** | Any time `synth.dsp` or `effects.dsp` hslider paths change |
| **`src/state/factory-presets.ts`** | Any parameter added/removed/renamed — presets must include all params |
| **`src/types.ts`** | New shared types are introduced |
| **`src/styles/main.css`** | New design tokens needed |

`src/audio/params.ts` and `docs/SOUND_ENGINE.md` must always agree on parameter names,
ranges, defaults, and module slot assignments. They are two views of the same truth.
When adding a param, also add `ParamSignalHints` if applicable (see `docs/SIGNAL_TESTING.md`).

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Never hardcode MIDI note/CC numbers.** All BeatStep values come from `BeatStepMapping`.
  Pad notes and encoder CCs vary by user configuration (MIDI Control Center). Tests use
  `TEST_BEATSTEP_MAPPING`. Production code receives the mapping from calibration — no
  fallbacks to "factory defaults". The mapping itself is nullable: when no BeatStep is
  calibrated, BeatStep-side handlers (`ControlMapper`, `PadHandler`) are not constructed
  at all, and the mouse path stands in.

- **MIDI inputs split into two roles, not three.** `MIDIManager` only fingerprints the
  BeatStep. Every other connected input — KeyStep, MPK Mini, Push, an iPad over USB —
  is a "note source" and routes through `onNoteSourceMessage` → `NoteHandler` → engine.
  Do not add per-vendor identification or channel filtering.

- **Computer keyboard is always live.** `ComputerKeyboardInput` attaches at boot and runs
  alongside any plugged-in MIDI keyboard. It calls `noteHandler.noteOn/noteOff` directly,
  not through a virtual MIDI port. It skips keystrokes when a form input has focus and
  releases all held notes on `window` blur.

- **Double-scaling encoder sensitivity.** `EncoderManager` already scales delta by `1/64`.
  If you call `processParamDelta(path, delta, sensitivity)` with the encoder's output as `delta`,
  pass `sensitivity=1`. Passing `1/64` again gives `1/4096` total — effectively broken for stepped params.

- **Snapshot excluding voices.** `voices` path is `"voices"` (not `"__voices"`). It IS saved with patches.
  Do not add exclusion filters back to `snapshot()`.

- **Wiring `store.onParamChange` in the wrong place.** This belongs in `app.ts` only.
  `ControlMapper.setStore()` must not touch `store.onParamChange`.

- **Faust keyword conflicts.** `waveform` is a reserved Faust word — use `wave_sel` as the
  variable name internally, but keep `hslider("waveform", ...)` for the param path.

- **BeatStep cannot respond to SysEx Identity Requests.** This is a hardware limitation.
  `manager.ts` runs a second pass after the SysEx timeout, identifying unassigned ports by name
  via `identifyByPortName()` in `fingerprint.ts`. Never rely on SysEx alone for BeatStep detection.

- **OscB is baseFreq-relative, not pitchModFreq-relative.** Changed from the original to avoid a
  circular dependency in the Faust signal graph (poly mod routes oscB → pitchModFreq, so oscB
  cannot depend on pitchModFreq). OscB tracks keyboard pitch independently; LFO vibrato does not
  modulate OscB's frequency.

- **`os.hs_phasor` creates phantom inputs.** Do NOT use `os.hs_phasor` from stdfaust.lib —
  it creates 3+ phantom signal inputs that break Faust polyphonic voice allocation (voices
  produce silence). Use the inline feedback phasor instead:
  `(+(f/ma.SR) : ma.frac) ~ (*(1.0 - syncTrig))`.

- **`fi.resonlp`/`fi.resonhp` require 3 args.** `fi.resonlp(fc, Q, gain)` — the `gain`
  parameter is required. Missing it causes a "number of inputs" compilation error. Use `gain=1`
  for unity gain.

- **Filter graph duplication causes OOM.** Using `hpfOut` in multiple filter paths (Moog + SVF LP
  + SVF HP) without `<:` split causes Faust to duplicate the entire upstream graph per path,
  creating 42+ phantom inputs and crashing `createNode`. Always use `hpfOut <: filter1, filter2,
  filter3 : combiner` to split the signal once.

- **Factory presets must stay in sync with params.** When adding/removing/renaming parameters,
  update `src/state/factory-presets.ts` to include the new params in preset patches. Missing
  params will fall back to defaults, which may not be musically appropriate for the preset.

- **Unison mode is engine + DSP.** `unison` toggles voice stacking in `engine.ts` (multiple
  keyOn events for one note) AND per-voice random detune in `synth.dsp` (via `ba.sAndH` on
  noise at gate trigger). Both sides must be wired for the feature to work.

- **COOP/COEP headers required.** `SharedArrayBuffer` (used by Faust WASM) needs cross-origin
  isolation. The Vite config sets these headers. Do not remove them.
